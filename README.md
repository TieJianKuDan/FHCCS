# A Class of 2n+1 Dimensional Simplest Hamiltonian Conservative Chaotic Systems and Fast Image Encryption Schemes
This is the source code of the proposed chaotic image encryption algorithem based a five-dimensional Hamiltonian conservative chaotic systems (FHCCS). If you have any problems, please publish to issues. At last, the paper has been published and you can access Ref. [1] for more details.
