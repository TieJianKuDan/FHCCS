# A Class of 2n+1 Dimensional Simplest Hamiltonian Conservative Chaotic Systems and Fast Image Encryption Schemes
This is the source code of the proposed chaotic image encryption algorithem based a five-dimensional Hamiltonian conservative chaotic systems (FHCCS). The paper is going to be published soon! If you have any problems, please publish to issues.
